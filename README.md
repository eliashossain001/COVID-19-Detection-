# COVID-19-Detection-

A highly infectious disease that emerged in China towards the end of 2019 is COVID-19, or more generally referred to as the Novel Coronavirus disease. SARS-CoV-2, a virus that belongs to the large coronavirus family, causes this disease. The disease first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and rapidly spread to over 213 countries, becoming a global pandemic.

Fever, dry cough, and fatigue are the most common COVID-19 symptoms. Aches, pains, and trouble breathing are some of the other symptoms that people can experience. The majority of these symptoms are signs of respiratory infections and lung abnormalities, which radiologists can identify.

Thus, it is possible to use Machine Learning algorithms to detect the disease from images of Chest X-rays and CT scans. Automated applications can be created to help support radiologists. This article is an attempt to use four Deep Learning algorithms, namely: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Xception.
